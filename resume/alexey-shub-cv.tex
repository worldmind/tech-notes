% Notes for cover letter:
%Software engineer with more than 8 years of software development experience including architecture designing, development and team management.
% The key area is backend development: billing/payment systems, SOA and microservices, scalable, fault tolerance systems, API development and integrations.
% Have sense of good (simple and flexible) architecture and readable code.
% Sure that simple as possible, based on business domain architecture and readable code is matter for doing good job.
% GNU/Linux user (Debian/Ubuntu)
%
% Extrimely small contribution to open sourse:
% * xonsh https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/pull/2805/files
% * lark https://github.com/lark-parser/lark/pull/260/files
%
% Prefer FLOSS tech with beautiful architecture and widely used
% like Python or with good chance to be popular like Rust.
% But I like to learn new technologies and know that good
% professional can do good job with any tool.
%
% Have interest (and use some online courses for self-education) in functional programming and machine learning.
%
% Two types of projects is interesting:
% 1. Project that do good things (and try do it better and better) with good team.
% 2. Projects where I can learn somethin new. I will be glad to learn something from:
% * Mathematical statistics (hypothesis testing, for data science for example)
% * Machine Learning (not only neural networks)
% * Natural Language Processing
% * Formal specification and verification of software
% * DSL creation (grammars)
% * Pure (or/and total) functional programming and related math theories (Category theory, Haskell, dependent types)
% * P2P/mesh technologies
% * Cryptography
% * Other things from computer science
% * BioInformatics
%
% Successful experience (~1.5 year) of working in distributed teams.
%
% Relocation is possible if project or country is interesting for me.
% For example: Finland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria.
%
% Not often business trips possible.
